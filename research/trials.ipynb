She spent her days roaming the green hills, munching on grass, and watching the clouds drift lazily by. One day, while gazing up at the sky, Lola spotted something peculiar - a vibrant orange cloud hovering in the distance.\\n\\nIntrigued, Lola decided to embark on a journey to find out more about this mysterious cloud. She packed a small bag with snacks, her favorite wool blanket, and set off early in the morning.\\n\\nAs she wandered through the valley, Lola encountered a wise old alpaca named Alberto. He offered her sage advice and a map, drawn on a piece of parchment, which supposedly led to the orange cloud.\\n\\nThe journey was long and arduous, taking Lola through dense forests, across rushing streams, and over steep mountain passes. Along the way, she met a friendly rabbit named Rosie, who shared some juicy carrots and tales of her own adventures.\\n\\nAs the sun began to set, Lola reached the foot of a majestic mountain range. The air grew thick with an otherworldly scent, and she could sense that she was getting close. With renewed determination, she climbed higher, her llama senses guiding her through the darkness.\\n\\n', 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 43, 'completion_tokens': 256, 'total_tokens': 299}}, 'success': True, 'errors': [], 'messages': []}\n"
